ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m David Garrett
I am currently a Computer Science Major at SFASU
My dream job is to be a game director down the line.
In the mean time, I have been programming and composing music.


Here on my GitHub is some of the assignments I have done for my computer science classes.
I have not gone through and fixed bugs since I turned them in, because I wasnt to show 
my journey and how i have learned from my mistakes.
The files should be sorted out by class, and if you have any questions, please let me know!
my website is: <https://www.davidrobertgarrett.com/>
